                                <li>Sina, a thought-provoking aptitude test, utilises Artificial Intelligence alongside a camera to determine students’ interests and skill sets.</li>
                                <li>Designed to determine a student’s preferred field of knowledge or ability in a skill, Sina’s patented technology enables students to understand their strong suits and pick up their desired course of study in the future.</li>
                                <li>As deciding on a career can be quite challenging, Sina aims to make the process easier so that students can embark on a career they will genuinely love.</li>
                                <li>The test includes 24 closed questions, taking less than 15 minutes. The students are seated in front of their laptops or computers with the camera on, ensuring they are focused on their answers for accurate results.</li>
                                <li>Sina analyses both conscious and subconscious responses. The answers given proactively are the conscious response, whereas the psycho-physiological changes that the stimuli of the questions elicit are the subconscious response.</li>
                                <li>Sina determines the innate taste of each student by taking a cumulative average of both the conscious and subconscious responses.</li>
                                <li class="sub-li">The results come in the form of a schedule specifying four categories:</li>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Intelligence profile (single broad ability like reading, knowledge of vocabulary)</li>
